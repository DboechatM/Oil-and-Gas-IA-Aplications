Here i try to develop aplications in O&G area. It's in construct and every week will be updated.

## Projects Developed
1. [Forecasting Oil and Gas Properties](https://github.com/DboechatM/Documentacao-TCC)
2. [Estimate multiphase flow rate in producing wells - **Forecasting Oil Production**](https://github.com/DboechatM/Oil-and-Gas-IA-Aplications/blob/main/LSTM_SISO.ipynb)
3. Well Ciment Quality Detection *[soon]*
4. Drilling params otimization *[soon]*
