The dataset comprises approximately 40,000 files from the Volve field, which was in production from 2008 to 2016. The data has been released to give students and scientists a realistic case to study.

Here i try to develop aplications in O&G area. It's in construct and every week will be updated.

## Projects Developed
1. [Forecasting Oil and Gas Properties - LSTM/GRU/AutoEncoder](https://github.com/DboechatM/Documentacao-TCC)
2. [Estimate multiphase flow rate in producing wells - **Forecasting Oil Production**](https://github.com/DboechatM/Oil-and-Gas-IA-Aplications/blob/main/LSTM_SISO.ipynb)
3. [Evaluation of the nominal thickness of pipelines - CNN/RNN] (https://github.com/DboechatM/Oil-and-Gas-IA-Aplications/tree/main/Sim_Dutos/simulacao.ipynb)
4. Well Ciment Quality Detection *[soon]*
5. Drilling params otimization *[soon]*
6. Safety Helmet Detection - Computer Vision (YOLO/OpenCV) *[soon]*
